## UNIT: Complete Milestone {{milestoneId}} ("{{milestoneTitle}}")

## Working Directory

Your working directory is `{{workingDirectory}}`. All file reads, writes, and shell commands MUST operate relative to this directory. Do NOT `cd` to any other directory.

## Your Role in the Pipeline

All slices are done. You are closing out the milestone — verifying that the assembled work actually delivers the promised outcome, writing the milestone summary, and updating project state. The milestone summary is the final record. After you finish, the system merges the worktree back to the integration branch. If there are queued milestones, the next one starts its own research → plan → execute cycle from a clean slate — the milestone summary is how it learns what was already built.

All relevant context has been preloaded below — the roadmap, all slice summaries, requirements, decisions, and project context are inlined. Start working immediately without re-reading these files.

{{inlinedContext}}

Then:
1. Use the **Milestone Summary** output template from the inlined context above
2. {{skillActivation}}
3. **Verify code changes exist.** Run `git diff --stat HEAD $(git merge-base HEAD main) -- ':!.gsd/'` (or the equivalent for the integration branch). If no non-`.gsd/` files appear in the diff, the milestone produced only planning artifacts and no actual code. Record this as a **verification failure**.
4. Verify each **success criterion** from the milestone definition in `{{roadmapPath}}`. For each criterion, confirm it was met with specific evidence from slice summaries, test results, or observable behavior. Record any criterion that was NOT met as a **verification failure**.
5. Verify the milestone's **definition of done** — all slices are `[x]`, all slice summaries exist, and any cross-slice integration points work correctly. Record any unmet items as a **verification failure**.
6. Validate **requirement status transitions**. For each requirement that changed status during this milestone, confirm the transition is supported by evidence. Requirements can move between Active, Validated, Deferred, Blocked, or Out of Scope — but only with proof.

### Verification Gate — STOP if verification failed

**If ANY verification failure was recorded in steps 3, 4, or 5, you MUST follow the failure path below. Do NOT proceed to step 7.**

**Failure path** (verification failed):
- Do NOT call `gsd_complete_milestone` — the milestone must not be marked as complete.
- Do NOT update `.gsd/PROJECT.md` to reflect completion.
- Do NOT update `.gsd/REQUIREMENTS.md` to mark requirements as validated.
- Write a clear summary of what failed and why to help the next attempt.
- Say: "Milestone {{milestoneId}} verification FAILED — not complete." and stop.

**Success path** (all verifications passed — continue with steps 7–11):

7. **Persist completion through `gsd_complete_milestone`.** Call it with: `milestoneId`, `title`, `oneLiner`, `narrative`, `successCriteriaResults`, `definitionOfDoneResults`, `requirementOutcomes`, `keyDecisions`, `keyFiles`, `lessonsLearned`, `followUps`, `deviations`, `verificationPassed: true`. The tool updates the milestone status in the DB, renders `{{milestoneSummaryPath}}`, and validates all slices are complete before proceeding.
8. Update `.gsd/REQUIREMENTS.md` if any requirement status transitions were validated in step 6.
9. Update `.gsd/PROJECT.md` to reflect milestone completion and current project state.
10. Review all slice summaries for cross-cutting lessons, patterns, or gotchas that emerged during this milestone. Append any non-obvious, reusable insights to `.gsd/KNOWLEDGE.md`.
11. Do not commit manually — the system auto-commits your changes after this unit completes.
- Say: "Milestone {{milestoneId}} complete."

**Important:** Do NOT skip the code change verification, success criteria, or definition of done verification (steps 3-5). The milestone summary must reflect actual verified outcomes, not assumed success. Verification failures BLOCK completion — there is no override. The milestone stays in its current state until issues are resolved and verification is re-run.

**File system safety:** When scanning milestone directories for evidence, use `ls` or `find` to list directory contents first — never pass a directory path (e.g. `tasks/`, `slices/`) directly to the `read` tool. The `read` tool only accepts file paths, not directories.
